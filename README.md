Slider Puzzle inspired by Oskar van Deventer



I found his realy cool Game on: 
http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?PHPSESSID=t3ksgscqc81576uj2oqj3h7sh2&topic=79552.0

So I made my own version of this Puzzle. While Oskar's puzzles are hard-coded, my version generates the puzzles randomly. The rest is similar to Oskar's.
